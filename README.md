# LifeSigns Front End

LifeSigns is a Hospital management system that aims to handle and direct the medical team and their patients. The application allows for nurses and doctors to register for an account, login, and edit their profile. Nurse can create charts and input patient data, while doctors can create and finalize a diagnosis for the patient on that chart. Finally, the application will survey the nurses and doctors for Covid-19 information to track potential outbreak risks.
